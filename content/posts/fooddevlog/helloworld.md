No matter what type of person you are, we all have one thing in common. We need to eat. We eat 3 times a day on average. Yet we seem to have difficulty answering the question "What to eat?"

> What should we eat?

## Idea

Build a simple to use solution that would allow users to make an informed decision on what to eat. The choice of where to eat should be based on certain given criteria.

### Verdict

We are going with option 1

## Mock up

Basic mock up of how the app would look like. Please give chance. I'm a software engineer. Not a designer. But it would look rather basic for now and we can iterate through the design in the future.

## Existing Solutions

There are existing solutions to these problem.

### Google Maps

For me, I use google maps and their "food near me" feature to help me find locations near me. Then based on the quantity and quality of the reviews, I will choose where to eat.

### Food Blogs (Recommendations)

## Follow Up action

Learn how to build a mobile app with React Native.

Choose colors for the app

Finalize the feature and a user stories for the app

## Conclusion

There will be some that have question regarding if this app will make money. Well, no. The problem it solves might not even be real. But the real goal is to build something outside of work.

## Others

With this in mind, we have 3 options to work with.

### Option 1 - Chat Bot

Use a telegram bot that can give you recommendations on what to eat. Like ChatGPT for food.

Pros:

1. Telegram is widely used. So it can reach a big group of people instantly.

2. Free to build on

Cons:

1. Design and control of the bot behavior is limited to what telegram exposes to us.

2. Limited room to expand in terms of features

3. If we are aiming to use natural language, it might be expensive

### Option 2

Build a mobile app that would achieve this.

### Option 3
